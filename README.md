## About The Project

  </a>

There're quite a few WhatsApp chat analyzers out there in the App and PlayStore today, but none of them gave me what I was looking for... How quickly the other person was taking to reply to my texts!

 :alarm_clock: **IN OTHER WORDS, OUR REPLY TIMINGS!** :alarm_clock: 

Currently, the app is still in it's 🏗 early development stage  🏗, and hence unavailable on the Google Play Store. But do feel free to fork the project and make any impmovements, modifications, and enhancements as you see fit! After all, that's what open source is for 😊
<br><br>


## Key Features
Here're some of its key highlights and functionality. <br><br>
*  :alarm_clock:  <b>Reply Timing Analysis : </b> Of course, that's the whole point of this app, right? Available in both 🔢 (numerical analysis) and 📉 (visual analysis).

*  :kissing_heart: <b>Your Personal Account : </b> Yup, your chats will all be stored (securely, of course) in the 🌨, with some server-side Firebase 🎩magic🎩, just in case you don't wish to keep them on your phone!

* :alarm_clock:  <b>Message Count Analysis : </b> Just to let you know if you're being too chatty or quiet in your conversations 😉

<br><br>
Of course, this is a simple app with very limited functionality right now, but do let me know (drop me a 📧DM📧 or 😓issue😓) if you've any ideas on how I should go about expanding its scope! <br><br>
